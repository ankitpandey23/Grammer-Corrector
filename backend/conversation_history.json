    "content": "The corrected sentence is:\n\n\"They told me to come there.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the mistakes:\n\n* \"they\" should be \"They\", which is the correct subject-verb agreement in plural nouns. In this context, \"They\" is a singular pronoun, and the verb is agreeing with it.\n* The sentence implies that someone or something (implied to be coming) told the speaker to come. However, without further information, it's not clear what they meant by \"told me\". To make the sentence clearer, we could add more context or specify who was telling them.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like to imply that someone sent a message or gave instructions for something to happen, you could rephrase the sentence as:\n\n\"They asked me to come there.\"\n\nOr:\n\n\"They told me to go there.\""
